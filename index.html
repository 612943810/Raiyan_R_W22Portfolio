        <h1>Personal Data&#129299;</h1>
        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>I am a final year student at George Brown College. Ever since I was born, I was alway intrigued at solving
            logical puzzles. I have experience in all sorts of development. With knowledge comes passion and I like to be
            "passionate" about all new technologies.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            My main interests are data science and mobile applications. I enjoy crunching data and developing new mobile
            apps. Data intrigues me and I am always looking at the latest trends. Mobile apps tend to be fun to make
            with a new technology at every twist and turn. My programming language of expertise is Python,Java,Javascript and
            Swift.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            To learn is to suffer and I take my tasks very seriously. My full effort goes into every project.My current
            plan is to go to a university and attain a bacholer degree.After that I want to become a mobile app
            developer or data scientist.

        </p>
        <h2>Statement of Career Goal</h2>
        <p>I believe every task must be completed on time. In my spare time, I do some projects on my own to expand my skill set.
            There is always something new to learn and strive. I will become a mobile app developer or data analyst withen the next 5
            years. I will takes any certification that is required to meet this goal.</p>

                        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                        <p><strong>About the company:</strong> <br>Mötley Zoo is a privately owned company which
                            specializes in several
                            services centered around dogs and cats primarily based in the east end of Toronto. Services
                            include group dog walking, private dog walking, pet taxi services, and cat visits.
                            About the project: Currently the company relies on a third-party service provided by “Time
                            To Pet” which bears a cost of $100US per month for three staff members, plus additional
                            charges of 3% of the cost of each payment through their payment gate and additional $10US
                            charge per newly added staff member.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Our project offers to bring an alternative to this system which maintains all of the core
                            features, such as scheduling, messaging, reports, invoicing and a payment gate, and further
                            expands the user base ability to any number of staffers. All at a reduced cost of covering
                            just
                            the hosting costs for the system, and the payment gate fees through Stripe
                            (https://stripe.com), which is 2.9% of each payment. All of this would be done behind a
                            secured and company-owned login/membership system.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Project Vision</h2>
                        <p>Capstone Team 09 will strive to develop a fully functioning system to replace the high cost
                            “Time
                            To Pet” system that Mötley Zoo is currently relying on, at a fraction of their current
                            costs, with
                            expanded features including a more customized set of business requirements for Mötley Zoo’s
                            business model. The system will implement several features including a scheduler with
                            varying
                            functionality depending on user type, communications and reporting, report exports to pdf,
                            automated emailing, and a payment gate, with additional features planned for later expansion
                            which TTP does not cover. </p>
